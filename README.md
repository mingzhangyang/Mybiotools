# Mybiotools
Python scripts for biologists

*This is a project for personal use at first. It is not a professional programme covering every corner in biology. Please give BioPython a try if you are looking for a tool of that kind.*

The main functions of the scripts are listed below:

  1. process a DNA or protein sequence to calculate its characteristics and design primers

  2. Search NCBI for the information about a gene, such as mRNA variants, mRNA sequences, CDS

  3. Search Uniprot for the information about a protein, such as AA sequence

  4. Collecting popular online tools in one place, such as PSIPRED

Please find **Mybiotools show.ipynb** to explore how Mybiotolls work.
