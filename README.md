# Mybiotools
Python scripts for biologists

*This is a project for personal use at the very begining. It is not a program covering every piece of biology. The main purpose is just to make my routine work a bit easier and more streamlined. If you are looking for a advanced python scripts suit for biology, please give BioPython a shot.*

The main functionalities of the scripts are listed below:

  1. process and analyze DNA or protein sequences
    - remove '\n','\t', '\r' and numbers that are in the DNA or protein sequences
    - get reversed complementory sequence
    - read a local fasta file
    - read a fastq file and plot quality scores
    - design primers
    - slice the sequence to pieces of length of interest
    - translate DNA or mRNA sequence to protein
    - find recognition sites of restriction enzymes
    - look up genetic codons
    - ...

  2. Search NCBI for the information about a gene, such as mRNA variants, mRNA sequences, CDS

  3. Search Uniprot for the information about a protein, such as AA sequence

  4. find and apply popular online tools in one place, such as PSIPRED

Please find **Mybiotools demo.ipynb** to explore how it works.
